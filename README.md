This project was a group project for our Java education YHC3L(http://yhc3l.se/) that we started in August 2013. This was our first Scrum project involving relational database (MySQL) with Java API and a simple console tool. It was a course over four weeks, divided into two sprints. 

Files you find in this repository is: 
- The assignment, Floggit webshop part 1
- Our Java code
- SQL files that setup our database, create an admin user and a couple of SQL-syntax we have had good use of
- Excel document in both English and Swedish with our Burndowncharts for both sprints and a short protocol from our first sprint retrospective
- A short text on handy commands in Git
